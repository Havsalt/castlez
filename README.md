An open world demo made using `charz`

## Rational

I wanted to make a demo using my terminal game engine `charz`, to see what it could do on a basic level, and how fast it was to work with. It originally used my other library `displaylib`, but ever since the development of `displaylib` deviated from the original vision, I only wanted to start over. That's why I created `charz`, so it could be like I intended from the start. I also had a good time converting the old `displaylib` code of this demo to using `charz`.
